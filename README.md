# real_estate_web_app_and_chatbot
This project was power by SKG.Code. Its aim was to create a real estate chatbot as long as a functional web application. We worked in a small team consisting by 4 people who met for the fist time for the needs of this project. In order to collaborate we used the scrum framework. After about 100 hours of work and collaboration the outcome is quite satisfying. The main technologies used are: botkit (as the chatbot framework), NodeJS, MySql, PHP, JQuery.
